Ever found yourself copying something useful, only to accidentally overwrite it with something else seconds later?

I've been there. Windows has a clipboard history feature built in â€” BUT it's limited, buggy, and doesn't quite do enough for real-world use.

ðŸ‘Ž The built-in Windows clipboard:
- Stores only 25 items
- Clears everything on restart
- No search or categorization
- No support for files
- Misses to record things sometimes
- Does not have searchability
- Does not have categorization
- and a lot more
But we can do better â€” and we will.

ðŸ¥… Goal: To build a better clipboard manager. BetterClip will have:
- [x]Unlimited history
- [x] Searchability
- [x] Persistent storage across reboots
- [x] Auto-deletion of old records
- [] Restore on startup?
- [x] Support for text, images, files, URLs
- [x] Tabs for categorization [All | Texts | Images | Files | URLs | +]
- [x] Option to pin
- [x] Global hotkey to launch
- [x] Incognito mode to temporarily disable recording
